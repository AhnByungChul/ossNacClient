This project is for developing Network Access Control Clients for linux
Especially this project is targetting (but not limitted to) the following platform
*gurum OS
*Tmax OS
*harmonica OS



Network Access Control solution is for protection network from malicious endpoints
There are many types of endpoints, Windows, linux, MAC OS. But to the recent days,
Most of NAC clients only supports Windows platform. This project aims on developing
NAC clients on linux platform especially on Korean Open OS.



So we have to develop
- User Authentication meechanism and its user interfaces
- client package update procedure
- Inspect the integrity of end point platform and integrity of nac client itself
- Endpoint policy download and enforcements
